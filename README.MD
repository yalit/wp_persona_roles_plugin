# Objective

The objective of this plugin is to be able to create listing of group of people that have responsibility in a community (develop specifically first for my parish).

It allows to create Persons, Roles, Groups and combine them into Affectations. Ultimately, a shortcode is existing to display those information in listing on any page of the site.
